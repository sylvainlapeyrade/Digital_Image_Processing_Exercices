# TSBB08-Digital_Image_Processing_Labs
Labs implementation for the Digital Image processing course TSBB08 in Link√∂ping University.

* **Lab1** - Operations on gray scale images. Linear filters in the spatial and Fourier domain
* **Lab2** - Resampling - Image rotation.
* **Lab3** - Histogram and gray scale transformation. Operations on binary images. Distance maps.
* **Lab4** - Automatic threshholding and simple OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
* **Lab5** - Segmentation of cells in microscopy images.
* **Lab6** - Automatic counting of blood cells. Experiments with the structure tensor.
* **Lab7** - Image restoration. Edge detection with Hough transform and Canny.
